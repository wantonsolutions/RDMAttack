\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work we demonstrated a critical fault in the security of RoCEv2, mainly
that it has little to no security, and that a trivial man in the middle attack
can recommend the protocol. In addition we benchmark the CPU performance of
current encryption algorithms and show that any future RoCE standard must
incorporate NIC offloaded encryption to support the line rate bandwidths
demanded by RDMA.
