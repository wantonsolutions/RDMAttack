\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}

RDMA is growing in popularity and it's adoption is slowy growing beyond the
secure world of the data center. As a high throughput protocol RDAM was never
designed with security in mind and is open for attacks.

In this work we review prior work on securing RDMA, \emph{Demonstrate that
current proposed securty protocls such as TLS and RDMA specific security cannot
scale to 100Gb networking}. Demonstrate that RDMA traffic can be hijacked using
a trivial man in the middle attack, and propose high throughput security
privatives for securing RDMA.
