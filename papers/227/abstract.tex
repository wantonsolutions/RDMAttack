RDMA is growing in popularity and it's adoption is slowly growing beyond the
secure world of the data centre. As a high throughput protocol RDMA was never
designed with security in mind and is open for attacks.

In this work we review prior work on securing RDMA, \emph{Demonstrate that
current proposed security protocols such as TLS and RDMA specific security cannot
scale to 100Gb networking}. Demonstrate that RDMA traffic can be hijacked using
a trivial man in the middle attack, and propose high throughput security
primitives for securing RDMA.
